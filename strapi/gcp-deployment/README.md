# Notes on Strapi deployment

## Deploying GCP infrastructure with Terraform

### Setting up

Ensure that `terraform` and `gcloud` are installed.

Set your desired database username and password in `secret.tfvars`.

If you already have a remote terraform state on GCS ready for use (as defined in `backend.tf`),
simply run `terraform init` to set up terraform.
Otherwise, set up terraform from scratch as follows:
1. Comment out `backend.tf`
2. Run `terraform init`: this initially sets up terraform with a local state
3. Run `npm run terraform-deploy-init`: this will deploy a GCS bucket to hold your remote terraform state
4. Uncomment `backend.tf` and replace `bucket` with the name of the created GCS bucket
5. Run `terraform init` again and enter "yes" when prompted to copy pre-existing state: this will set up terraform to switch to a remote state
   - If it fails with an error saying that the bucket does not exist, run `gcloud auth application-default login`
6. (Optional) Delete your local copies of `terraform.tfstate` and `terraform.tfstate.backup`

### Deployment

Run `npm run terraform-deploy` to deploy the GCP resources for Strapi using terraform.
This may take about 20 minutes.

## Deploying to App Engine

Ensure that `gcloud` is installed and that you are authenticated via `gcloud auth login`.
Ensure that your Cloud Build service account has the appropriate IAM permissions for deployment by following
[this section](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/deploying-builds/deploy-appengine#grant-permissions) of the App Engine deployment guide.

Copy `app.template.yaml` to `app.yaml` and replace the database username, password, and instance identifiers appropriately.

To deploy Strapi to App Engine, run `npm run app-deploy`.

## Collections

To create or update collections on Strapi, run Strapi locally using `npm run develop` and change the collections using the admin console.
Commit and push the local changes with `git`, then re-deploy the latest changes to App Engine.
